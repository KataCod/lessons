        <h2>Usage review of the bike</h2>
        <p>
          The Optimo’s designers clearly kept an eye on practicality, with
          bosses front and rear for mudguards, and a removable plastic bridge
          between the seatstays to act as a mount in lieu of a brake bridge,
          which isn’t needed on the disc version. The brake outers are partly
          concealed within the frame and fork, but most of the cabling is on
          show for fuss-free fettling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shimano’s 10-speed Tiagra seems to have become the go-to groupset in
          this price range and it’s good stuff, offering smooth, low-effort
          shifting and easy reach adjustment at the levers. Cannondale doesn’t
          give you the matching cranks here, and the FSA Omega substitute is, to
          my eyes, a little bit aesthetically challenged. my eyes, a little bit
          aesthetically challenged. <br class="break" />It’s not a great choice
          if you’ve got a wonky pedalling style, as the finish wears offif you
          do more than glance at it. my eyes, a little bit aesthetically
          challenged.

        <h2>User opinion</h2>
        <p class="opinion">
          The Optimo rides well but isn’t particularly light thanks to a fairly
          average spec for the money. It’s a very competent bike that ticks the
          boxes for versatility and all-round likeability, but it isn’t the most
          exciting thing in the world, especially compared to the true greats
          that have carried the CAAD moniker.
