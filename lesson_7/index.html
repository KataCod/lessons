        <h1>How to Leave Your Comfort Zone</h1>
        <div class="pretext">
          <p>
            Sometimes we’re forced out of our comfort zone by our situations and
            have to adapt in the moment. But if you want to actively move
            yourself out of your comfort zone, here’s how to get started.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-practice1">
          <p>
            <span> Set a goal.</span> First, decide what you want to achieve and
            set a goal. Make it a SMART goal: specific, measurable, attainable,
            relevant, and time-bound.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Make a plan.</span> Once you have your specific goal, now you
            can make a plan to achieve it. If a 5k is on a certain date, you
            know how long you have to train. If you want to be able to run or
            jog the whole way, you need to increase your ability and stamina to
            get to that point before the race. Make a plan for how you’ll get to
            your goal, which will include steps that move you out of your
            comfort zone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span> Adjust as you go.</span> Realize that you may not always be
            successful in your efforts. Everyone has a bad day or two when
            trying to accomplish something, so don’t let it derail you from
            achieving your goal. However, if you’re constantly feeling like the
            tasks are too hard, you may have gone past your growth zone into the
            panic zone. Reassess your plan to see how you can simplify the
            tasks.
