        <h3>Research Destinations</h3>
        <p>
          Start by researching potential bikepacking destinations. Consider
          factors like
          <span class="destination"
            >distance, terrain, weather, and difficulty level.</span
          >
          Whether you prefer rugged mountain trails or scenic coastal roads,
          choose a location that matches your skill level and interests.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Create a Route</h3>

        <p>
          Once you've selected a destination, create a detailed route. Utilize
          mapping apps like <span class="apps">Ride with GPS or Strava</span>,
          which provide route planning tools. Take into account the distance you
          want to cover each day and plan your overnight stops accordingly.
          Ensure there are accommodations or camping sites along the way.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Check Regulations</h3>

        <p>
          Review any permits or regulations that apply to your chosen route.
          Some areas may require permits for camping or have specific rules
          regarding campfires and waste disposal. Make sure you're compliant
          with all local regulations.

      <div>
        <h3>Bikepacking Bags</h3>
        <p>
          Invest in bike-specific bags designed for bikepacking. These bags
          attach to your bike's frame, handlebars, and seat post, distributing
          weight evenly and keeping your gear secure.
